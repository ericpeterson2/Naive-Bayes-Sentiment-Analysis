# Naive-Bayes-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis involves identifying the attitude or opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as a document or speech. It has practical uses in areas like marketing, where customer feedback in the form of comments, reviews, and messages can be analyzed to improve business strategies. One common method for performing sentiment analysis is using a bag of words model, which represents a document as a numerical vector by counting the number of times each word appears. This is, of course, a substantial simplification as it disregards the linguistic structure of the document.
